# About:
#
#   This little script will check whether there is a database
#   located in users $HOME directory, and depending on the result
#   it will create one. After all it will call bin/remind.py
#   passing all arguments to it.
#

# got it from http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128
# DIR is a directory from where this script is called
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

# check whether there is no ~/remind.db file
